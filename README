    Nean der taler, an intro for The Party 2k

    Code      : Macaw/Non Alien Nature 5 (rasmus@cromatics.dk)
    Music     : Prat/Bypass
    Unix port : Marq/Fit                 (marq@iki.fi)

    To view this intro you need the X11 and OpenGL libraries, libmikmod
    and GLUT. You probably don't have the versions that the Linux binary
    requires, so go ahead and compile yourself (just type 'make'). By
    default the prod runs windowed, hit space or give parameter -f to
    see it fullscreen. The source is totally free to use and modify, so
    no license hassle. Tested on a couple of Linux boxes plus SGI O2 and
    Onyx 2. For SGI and other systems edit the Makefile to suit your
    config.

    Feel free to contact me (Marq) if you'd like to port your demos to
    Linux/Unix.
